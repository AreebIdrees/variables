 variables are a fundamental concept used to store and manage data. They act as containers that hold information that can be manipulated, updated, and used in various ways throughout your code. Variables are a crucial part of writing dynamic and functional programs.

What Are Variables?
Variables are symbolic names for values or data. They allow you to give a name to a piece of data, making it easier to work with and reference. Variables can store different types of data, such as numbers, text, or even complex data structures.

Variable Naming Rules
When naming variables, it's essential to follow some naming rules:

Variable names should start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
Variable names can contain letters, digits (0-9), and underscores.
Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning "myVariable" and "myvariable" are considered different names.
Choose descriptive and meaningful names for variables to make your code more readable.
Data Types
In programming, variables have data types that define the kind of data they can store. Common data types include:

Integer (int): Used for whole numbers (e.g., 42, -10).
Floating-Point (float, double): Used for numbers with decimal points (e.g., 3.14, -0.5).
String (str): Used for text and character data (e.g., "Hello, World!").
Character (char): Used for single characters (e.g., 'A', '7').
Boolean (bool): Used for representing true or false values.
Declaring and Initializing Variables
To use a variable in your program, you must declare and optionally initialize it. Declaration informs the compiler of the variable's name and data type, while initialization assigns an initial value.
